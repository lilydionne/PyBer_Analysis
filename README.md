# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
As a data analyst for Pyber, I was tasked with performing an exploratory analysis on large sets of data in CSV files. Within this analysis, I'll be showcasing the relationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders, as well as their fares. Additionally, I am also tasked with creating visuals that help to tell a story on the analysis I've performed using Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib. 

## Results

Based on our finding, as illustrated in this line chart, you can see that Urban city type consistently has a higher average fare than Suburban or Rural, with Rural having the lowest among the city types.

Overall, we can see from our pie charts that Urban city types is responsible for about 60% of rides and fares, but has a larger percentage of drivers in comparison. This may be a opportuntity to find improvements in performance.

## Summary
Based on the results, here are some business recommendations for the PyBer CEO for addressing some disparities among the city types: 
 1. Increase Suburban Drivers: Suburban city types have a lower percentage of drivers when compared to the number of rides and percentage of fare. Adding more drivers may help to increase ride volumes, and therefore see a lift in fares as well.
 2. Review Peak Weeks: All city types saw a lift in fare the last week of February. Recommend looking into this time period to determine what cause the lift and how to maxmize that in the future.
 3. Increase Urban Fares: The average fare per ride in urban city types is about $6 less than in Suburban city types, while the average fare per driver is about $23 less than Suburban cities.
